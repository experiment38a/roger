The birth card and enveloppe are made out of growing paper. Don't just throw us away but plant us. This way the world for our little Roger becomes a bit more colorfull.
1. Plant the growing paper in the garden in a sunny spot preferably in April or May. 
2. First soak the card overnight in lukewarm water. 

If you sow them in September or October you will get flowers in the spring and summer after that. The seeds then go into dormancy in winter and only germinate when the weather is good enough.
